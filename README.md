This project involves re-creating the google homepage as part of The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). The home page has been created using html and css. The form element in html does not feeback to a database as this isn't in the scope of the project.

Reflections:

1) I have learn't what I did know and what I didn't through the process of recreating the page without looking at the source code.

2) Applying the skills and trying different ways to achieve the desired layout has sparked an interest to undertake more complex projects.
